# LeetCode_Round_4
Round4

In this round4, I will only include old problems that needs more practice.

New problems will be added to Round_3 repo to keep the completeness

(Starting date: 06/12/2016)

(Ending date: 07/10/2016)



Today I am done with round 4. I reviewed all problems in LeetCode and rewrote most of the problems (at least 95%+)

The speed was fast in the beginning (20 problems/day), but then the speed decreased(10~20 problems/day). The admin of LeetCode was continuously publishing one problem per day for two weeks in this round 4. 

I had the most diffcult week when doing problems 301-336 (0 ~ 10 problems/day).

At one hand, those problems were newly added and diffcult, at the other hand, I had heavy pressure from my work. I was being really tired during this period. But finally I survived and completed this round 4.

Anyway, Round 4 is finished! Cheers!

Remark: To save time I rewrote all problems in the same session with round 3.
